Description: This package contains the building blocks of a mixed linear model
   GWAS that uses EMMAX at its core. Using mxr requires several helper or core
   applications that need to be installed. Warning or error messages will be
   issued whenever these applications were not found at run time. By design, the
   execution should terminate gracefully. Otherwise, please report it to the
   author.
